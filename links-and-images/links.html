    <h1>Links</h1>

    <p>To create an anchor, you need to use the anchor tag a.<br>
    To create a link, add the href attribute to the anchor.</p>
    <p>This is to the <a href="images.html">images</a> link.</p>

    <h2>Types of Links</h2>
    <p>There are three types of links:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Absolute links, like this one to
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">
        Mozilla Developer Network</a>, are the most detailed with a scheme,
        domain, and path. Use this mainly for outside links.</li>
      <li>Relative links point to another file in the same website, from the
        point of the current file. This one is to the <a href="miscellaneous/extras.html">
        extras</a> page.<br>
        The scheme and domain name are the assumed to be the same, so
        only the path needs to be changed.</li>
      <li>Root-relative links are similar to relative ones, but are instead
        relative to the root of the site. These do not work for local HTML files.
        You would use / in href as the path.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Link Targets</h2>
    <p>Some elements can accept a <em>target</em> attribute that defines where <br>
      to display the page when clicked. Use this to ask the browser to open a link
      in a new window/tab.</p>
    <p>For example, here's another link to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"
      target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network</a>.</p>
