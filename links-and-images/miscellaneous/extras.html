    <h1>Extra Stuff</h1>
    <p>To go back to a parent directory, use .. to refer to it.</p>
    <p>For example, this goes back to <a href="../links.html">
      links</a> and this one goes to <a href="../images.html">images</a>.</p>

    <h2>Naming Conventions</h2>
    <p>Typically you should not use spaces in URLs, because they require
      special handling.</p>
    <p>For example, if you had "this is bad" in the URL, it would show
      as "this%20is%20bad".</p>
    <p>Instead, you should use hyphens and keep everything lowercase. Also,
      it is good to name things to what they represent, since they are also
      visable to the user.</p>
    <p><strong>You should use these naming conventions for <em>all</em> files
      on the site!</strong></p>
