    <h1>Extra Stuff</h1>
    <p>To go back to a parent directory, use .. to refer to it.</p>
    <p>For example, this goes back to <a href="../links.html">
      links</a> and this one goes to <a href="../images.html">images</a>.</p>

    <h2>Naming Conventions</h2>
    <p>Typically you should not use spaces in URLs, because they require
      special handling.</p>
    <p>For example, if you had "this is bad" in the URL, it would show
      as "this%20is%20bad".</p>
    <p>Instead, you should use hyphens and keep everything lowercase. Also,
      it is good to name things to what they represent, since they are also
      visable to the user.</p>
    <p><strong>You should use these naming conventions for <em>all</em> files
      on the site!</strong></p>


    <h2>More HTML Attributes</h2>
    <h3>Document Language</h3>
    <p>A web page's default language is set by the <em>lang</em> attribute in the html element.<br>
      For example: "&lt;html lang="en"&gt;"</p>

    <h3>Character Sets</h3>
    <p>A character set is like a digital alphabet for your browser to use. It
     only affects how the letters are rendered and can render special characters
     correctly. Mostly UTF-8 is used now and you should include <br>
     "&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&rt;" in the <em>head</em> for every web page.</p>

    <p>Without UTF-8, these characters would be other weird characters!</p>
