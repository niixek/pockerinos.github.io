    <h1>Images</h1>

    <p>Image content is defined outside the web page. They are included in
      in web pages with the <em>img</em> tag and that tag has a <em>src</em> attribute.</p>
    <p>There are four main image formats:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>JPG</li>
      <li>GIF</li>
      <li>PNG</li>
      <li>SVG</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>JPG/JPEG</h3>
    <p>JPG/JPEGs are designed to handle large color palettes without drastically
      increasing the file size. Great for photos and images with lots of gradients.
      However, they don't allow transparent pixels.</p>

    <p>This is a JPG!</p>

    <h3>GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)</h3>
    <p>GIFs are good for simple animations, but they are limited in color palettes.
      Transparent pixels are either on or off.</p>

    <p>This is a GIF!</p>

    <h3>PNG (Portal Network Graphics)</h3>
    <p>PNGs are great for everything that's not a photo or animated. They
      are generally larger than JPGs of the same quality. They are great with
      opacity and have no color palette limitations. A great choice for diagrams
      and icons.</p>

    <p>This is a PNG!</p>

    <h3>SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)</h3>
    <p>SVGs are not like the others that are pixel-based; they are instead
      vector-based, so they can be scaled up/down without loss of quality.
      These are great for responsive design and generally have the same use cases
      as PNGs. However, there is one issue: getting them to display consistently
      across browsers. There are ways to fix this problem.</p>

    <h2>Image Dimensions</h2>
    <p>The <em>img</em> element inherits the dimensions of its image file by default. Pixel-
      based graphics need to be twice as big the size you want for retina displays.</p>
    <p>To get pixel-based images down to the size you want, you can use the <em>width</em> attribute
      for <em>img</em> elements.</p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <img src="images/practice-pics/mochi.jpg" width="75" alt="A mochi ball in a bubble">
    <img src="images/practice-pics/mochi.gif" width="75" alt="A dancing mochi ball">
    <img src="images/practice-pics/mochi.png" width="75" alt="A mochi ball">
    <p>There is also a <em>height</em> attribute, and setting either one will scale
      the other one proportionally. Setting both will stretch the image. These
      dimensions are defined in pixels.</p>

    <h2>Text Alternatives</h2>
    <p>Using the <em>alt</em> attribute for <em>img</em> elements allows a text alternative to be
      displayed, which can affect search engines and text-only browsers.</p>
