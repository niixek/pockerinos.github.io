    <h1>Images</h1>

    <p>Image content is defined outside the web page. They are included in
      in web pages with the img tag and that tag has a src attribute.</p>
    <p>There are four main image formats:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>JPG</li>
      <li>GIF</li>
      <li>PNG</li>
      <li>SVG</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>JPG/JPEG</h3>
    <p>JPG/JPEGs are designed to handle large color palettes without drastically
      increasing the file size. Great for photos and images with lots of gradients.
      However, they don't allow transparent pixels.</p>

    <p>This is a JPG!</p>

    <h3>GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)</h3>
    <p>GIFs are good for simple animations, but they are limited in color palettes.
      Transparent pixels are either on or off.</p>

    <p>This is a GIF!</p>

    <h3>PNG (Portal Network Graphics)</h3>
    <p>PNGs are great for everything that's not a photo or animated. They
      are generally larger than JPGs of the same quality. They are great with
      opacity and have no color palette limitations. A great choice for diagrams
      and icons.</p>
